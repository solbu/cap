This program is something I created sometime in 1994, 1995, or so,
as my 286 MS-DOS based computer did not have any way that I could find,
to display how much Free space there was on my harddrive.
Also I could not find a way to display how large the drive was, as I did not know.
And this is the result. I named the program CAP, as to reflect it displayed the drives capacity.

I made three versions, that displayed the result in bytes, kbytes and megabytes.
I tried to make it display the three types by using a command line switch,
but I never figured out how to do that, so I gave up.

I created this program by reading Turbo Pascal 5.0's built in help system,
which at the time I used it, had examples on how to use the various options.
So I played with the various commands, and this program is the result. :-)

A program like this is obsolete in todays computers, and I believe
there exists other programs like this that is better that this one.
But you might have an old computer running some version of DOS,
Like MS-DOS, DR-DOS or the like, and need or want this functionality.
So I thought I'd put it on the internet for other people to use.
And here it is.

The exe file included here, states it is "Freeware".
When I made this program, I had not heard of the idea of Free software, nor the GPL.
But I wanted to tell users that got a copy that this was free to use for anyone,
and I had learned what Freeware was, so I used that term, for lack of other terms.
However, it is relicensed to the GPLv3 as of now.

CAP is licensed under the GNU GPL version 3,
or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
